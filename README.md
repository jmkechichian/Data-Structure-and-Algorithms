# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms

## Description

Welcome to the Data Structure and Algorithms repository on GitHub. Here, you will find a collection of exercises completed in C during my course as a Computer Technology student, focusing on this fascinating subject. This repository aims to provide a wide range of solutions and approaches to common data structure and algorithm problems.

Within this repository, you will discover detailed implementations of various essential data structures, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Additionally, it presents classic and advanced algorithms, covering searches, sorting, recursion, and optimization techniques.

Through this project, my goal is to share my knowledge and experience in the field of data structures and algorithms with the community of programmers and students eager to enhance their programming skills. All exercises and code are open for you to learn, contribute, and improve your abilities in computer science and problem-solving.

I hope you find this repository valuable and educational on your journey to mastering data structures and algorithms. Welcome aboard, and enjoy exploring the world of programming and optimization!
